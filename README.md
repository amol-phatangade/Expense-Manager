## Getting Started

- Clone this repository to your machine
- Once downloaded, `cd` into the `expenses-manager` directory
- Within the directory, create a new Python 3.6+ virtual environment (e.g. `python3.6 -m venv env`)
- Activate that virtual environment (`source env/bin/activate`). Note, you'll need to have [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) installed on your machine to run it in development.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary packages into your virtual environment
